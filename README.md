# SellCollect -Tableau-Showcase

Hello! Welcome to my sample analysis for SellCollect a collector's marketplace<br>

**Objective of exercise:**
- Create a dashboard to improve and track the seller application process, from the first application to seller onboarding, with the aim of maximizing the number of successful onboardings while maintaining high seller quality standards.

**Dataset and exercise assumptions:**
- Contains data from application timestamps between 5/1/2022 - 7/1/2022
- The dataset needs to be analyzed quickly and the C-suite is looking for data-driven reccomendations where clarity on the dataset cannot be investigated (i.e. updating null values)
- Each application is first reviewed by the Screening Team, and then passed to the Category Team. If the application passes both screens, the applicant is moved to the 'Onboarding Status' and is invited to an onboarding session. Once the applicant has completed their onboarding, they will be live on the platform.
- Sellers are given grades for 3 categories:
    - Inventory Grade: Valuation of inventory for each seller applicant
    - Seller Grade: Seller reviews and approval rating
    - Social Grade: Social media presence (e.g., # of followers, posts relevant to what the applicant sells)
- Timestamp data definitions:
    - Application TS: when the application was submitted
    - Screening TS: when the screening team has made a decision (either accept or reject)
    - Category TS: when the category team has made a decision (either accept or reject)
